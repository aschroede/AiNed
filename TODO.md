# TODO

1. Disable the commit button if there are no dirty dipoles
2. Refactor the existing code to make it clean, organized, and reduce coupling and increase cohesian
3. Include a seed value on the random number generator so you always get the same output (deterministic)
3. Write unit tests for scenarios where there is only one dirty dipole
4. Update code to handle calculations for multiple dirty dipoles
6. Make sure you can write sequence of read-writes and states out to a file for comparison with testing guys
