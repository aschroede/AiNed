# TODO

1. Disable the commit button if there are no dirty dipoles
2. ~~Refactor the existing code to make it clean, organized, and reduce coupling and increase cohesian~~
3. ~~Include a seed value on the random number generator so you always get the same output (deterministic)~~
3. ~~Write unit tests for scenarios where there is only one dirty dipole~~
4. ~~Update code to handle calculations for multiple dirty dipoles~~
6. ~~Make sure you can write sequence of read-writes and states out to a file for comparison with testing guys~~
7. Make a CLI interface
   8. Make board size and parameter adjustable
   9. Allow to feed in a series of writes and generate the history
10. Make sure you can read in an initial set of values for a grid
8. Make sure you are not allowed to set dipole to unknown
9. Make sure you can write a state to a dipole that is already in that states (blue -> blue, red -> red)
10. Make sure results are reproducible with a seed
11. Make sure to use only integer values?
